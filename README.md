**Level: Beginner**

The goal of the assignment is to create a shopping cart.

![Preview](https://github.com/cobeisfresh/frontend-tasks/blob/shopping-cart/images/sketch.png)

### Requirements
* By clicking the "Add" button the selected product is being added to the cart
* The cart contains a list of all the products added and the total amount
* Once added, the product can be deleted from the cart
* One product can be added to the cart more than once, in which case it is necessary to write how many products are in the cart and their total amount individually

### Rules
* Use the product list contained in the [`products.json`](https://github.com/cobeisfresh/frontend-tasks/blob/shopping-cart/products.json) file
* The use of (web) technology and tools of your choice is allowed
* Use a repository from the beginning, don't push everything in just one commit
* Pay extra attention to the code quality, formatting and best practices

### Deliverables
* The code must be uploaded to the GitHub repository. When you complete the task, you should send us the link to the repository

### Extra mile
* Using type checker ([Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [Flow](https://flow.org/))
* App is deployed and live
* Suprise features that we don't expect to get
